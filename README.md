## Motivations

When visualizing images, it is not uncommon to provide a 2D view of different image sources.
For example, comparing multiple images of different sizes, getting a preview of machine
learning dataset. This package aims to provide easy-to-use tools for such tasks.

## Usage

### Compare two or more images

When comparing and showing multiple images, `cat`/`hcat`/`vcat/hvcat` can be helpful if the image
sizes and element types are the same. But if not, you'll need `mosaic` for this purpose.

```julia
# ImageCore reexports MosaicViews with some glue code for images
julia> using ImageCore, ImageShow, TestImages, ColorVectorSpace

julia> toucan = testimage("toucan") # 150×162 RGBA image

julia> moon = testimage("moon") # 256×256 Gray image

julia> mosaic(toucan, moon; nrow=1)
```

Like `cat`, `mosaic` makes a copy of the inputs.

### Get a preview of dataset

Many datasets in machine learning field are stored as 3D/4D array, where different images are different slices
along the 3rd and 4th dimensions.
`mosaicview` provides a convenient way to visualize a single higher-dimensional array as a 2D grid-of-images.

```julia
julia> using MosaicViews, ImageShow, MLDatasets

julia> A = MNIST.convert2image(MNIST.traintensor(1:9))
28×28×9 Array{Gray{Float64},3}:
[...]

julia> mosaicview(A, fillvalue=.5, nrow=2, npad=1, rowmajor=true)
57×144 MosaicViews.MosaicView{Gray{Float64},4,...}:
[...]
```

Unlike `mosaic`, `mosaicview` does not copy the input--it provides an alternative interpretation of the input data.
Consequently, if you modify pixels of the output of `mosaicview`, those modifications also apply to the parent array `A`.

`mosaicview` is essentially a flexible way of constructing a `MosaicView`; it provides
additional customization options via keyword arguments.
If you do not need the flexibility of `mosaicview`, you can directly call the `MosaicView` constructor.
The remainder of this page illustrates the various options for `mosaic` and `mosaicview` and then covers the low-level `MosaicView` constructor.

### More on the keyword options

`mosaic` and `mosaicview` use almost all the same keyword arguments (all except `center`, which is not relevant for `mosaicview`).
Let's illustrate some of the effects you can achieve.
First, in the simplest case:

```julia
julia> A1 = fill(1, 3, 1)
3×1 Array{Int64,2}:
 1
 1
 1

julia> A2 = fill(2, 1, 3)
1×3 Array{Int64,2}:
 2  2  2

# A1 and A2 will be padded to the common size and shifted
# to the center, this is a common operation to visualize
# multiple images
julia> mosaic(A1, A2)
6×3 MosaicView{Int64,4, ...}:
 0  1  0
 0  1  0
 0  1  0
 0  0  0
 2  2  2
 0  0  0
```

If desired, you can disable the automatic centering:

```julia
# disable center shift
julia> mosaic(A1, A2; center=false)
6×3 MosaicView{Int64,4, ...}:
 1  0  0
 1  0  0
 1  0  0
 2  2  2
 0  0  0
 0  0  0
```

You can also control the placement of tiles. Here this is illustrated for `mosaicview`, but
the same options apply for `mosaic`:

```julia
julia> A = [k for i in 1:2, j in 1:3, k in 1:5]
2×3×5 Array{Int64,3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  1  1
 1  1  1

[:, :, 2] =
 2  2  2
 2  2  2

[:, :, 3] =
 3  3  3
 3  3  3

[:, :, 4] =
 4  4  4
 4  4  4

[:, :, 5] =
 5  5  5
 5  5  5

# number of tiles in column direction
julia> mosaicview(A, ncol=2)
6×6 MosaicViews.MosaicView{Int64,4,...}:
 1  1  1  4  4  4
 1  1  1  4  4  4
 2  2  2  5  5  5
 2  2  2  5  5  5
 3  3  3  0  0  0
 3  3  3  0  0  0

# number of tiles in row direction
julia> mosaicview(A, nrow=2)
4×9 MosaicViews.MosaicView{Int64,4,...}:
 1  1  1  3  3  3  5  5  5
 1  1  1  3  3  3  5  5  5
 2  2  2  4  4  4  0  0  0
 2  2  2  4  4  4  0  0  0

# take a row-major order, i.e., tile-wise permute
julia> mosaicview(A, nrow=2, rowmajor=true)
4×9 MosaicViews.MosaicView{Int64,4,...}:
 1  1  1  2  2  2  3  3  3
 1  1  1  2  2  2  3  3  3
 4  4  4  5  5  5  0  0  0
 4  4  4  5  5  5  0  0  0

# add empty padding space between adjacent mosaic tiles
julia> mosaicview(A, nrow=2, npad=1, rowmajor=true)
5×11 MosaicViews.MosaicView{Int64,4,...}:
 1  1  1  0  2  2  2  0  3  3  3
 1  1  1  0  2  2  2  0  3  3  3
 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
 4  4  4  0  5  5  5  0  0  0  0
 4  4  4  0  5  5  5  0  0  0  0

# fill spaces with -1
julia> mosaicview(A, fillvalue=-1, nrow=2, npad=1, rowmajor=true)
5×11 MosaicViews.MosaicView{Int64,4,...}:
  1   1   1  -1   2   2   2  -1   3   3   3
  1   1   1  -1   2   2   2  -1   3   3   3
 -1  -1  -1  -1  -1  -1  -1  -1  -1  -1  -1
  4   4   4  -1   5   5   5  -1  -1  -1  -1
  4   4   4  -1   5   5   5  -1  -1  -1  -1
```

### The `MosaicView` Type

The `MosaicView` constructor is simple and straightforward;
if you need more layout options, consider calling it indirectly
through `mosaicview`.

The layout of the mosaic is encoded in the third
(and optionally fourth) dimension. Creating a `MosaicView` this
way is type stable, non-copying, and should in general give
decent performance when accessed with `getindex`.

Let us look at a couple examples to see the type in action. If
`size(A)` is `(2,3,4)`, then the resulting `MosaicView` will have
the size `(2*4,3)` which is `(8,3)`.

```julia
julia> A = [k for i in 1:2, j in 1:3, k in 1:4]
2×3×4 Array{Int64,3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  1  1
 1  1  1

[:, :, 2] =
 2  2  2
 2  2  2

[:, :, 3] =
 3  3  3
 3  3  3

[:, :, 4] =
 4  4  4
 4  4  4

julia> MosaicView(A)
8×3 MosaicViews.MosaicView{Int64,3,Array{Int64,3}}:
 1  1  1
 1  1  1
 2  2  2
 2  2  2
 3  3  3
 3  3  3
 4  4  4
 4  4  4
```

Alternatively, `A` is also allowed to have four dimensions. More
concretely, if `size(A)` is `(2,3,4,5)`, then the resulting size
will be `(2*4,3*5)` which is `(8,15)`. For the sake of brevity
here is a slightly smaller example:

```julia
julia> A = [(k+1)*l-1 for i in 1:2, j in 1:3, k in 1:2, l in 1:2]
2×3×2×2 Array{Int64,4}:
[:, :, 1, 1] =
 1  1  1
 1  1  1

[:, :, 2, 1] =
 2  2  2
 2  2  2

[:, :, 1, 2] =
 3  3  3
 3  3  3

[:, :, 2, 2] =
 5  5  5
 5  5  5

julia> MosaicView(A)
4×6 MosaicViews.MosaicView{Int64,4,Array{Int64,4}}:
 1  1  1  3  3  3
 1  1  1  3  3  3
 2  2  2  5  5  5
 2  2  2  5  5  5
```

### Customizing promotion

When the inputs are heterogeneous, `mosaic` attempts to convert the elements of all input arrays to a common type;
if this promotion step throws an error, consider extending `MosaicViews.promote_wrapped_type` for your types.

`ImageCore` provides such extensions for colors defined in [ColorTypes](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/ColorTypes.jl).
You will likely want to load that package if you're using MosaicViews with `Colorant` arrays.
(`ImageCore` gets loaded by nearly all the packages in the JuliaImages suite, so you may find that it is already loaded.)
